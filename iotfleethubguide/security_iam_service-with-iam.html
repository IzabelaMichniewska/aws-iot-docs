                                    can't specify the principal in an identity-based policy because it applies to the

                                 <p>Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. Examples
                                    of resource-based policies are 
                                    IAM <em>role trust policies</em> and Amazon S3 <em>bucket policies</em>. In services that support resource-based policies, service 
                                    administrators can use them to control access to a specific resource. For the resource
                                    where the policy is attached, the policy defines what actions
                                    a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions. You
                                    must <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html">specify a principal</a> in a resource-based policy. Principals 
                                    can include accounts, users, roles, federated users, or AWS services.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 
                                 <p>To enable cross-account access, you can specify an entire account or IAM entities
                                    in another account as the principal in a
                                    resource-based policy. Adding a cross-account principal to a resource-based
                                    policy is only half of establishing the trust relationship. When the principal and
                                    the
                                    resource are in different AWS accounts, an IAM administrator in the trusted account
                                    
                                    must also grant the principal entity (user or role) permission to access the resource.
                                    They grant 
                                    permission by attaching an identity-based policy to the entity. However, if a resource-based
                                    
                                    policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based
                                    policy is 
                                    required. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_compare-resource-policies.html">How

                                 <p>Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines permissions
                                    based on attributes. In AWS, these attributes are called <em>tags</em>. You can attach tags to IAM entities (users
                                    or roles) and to many AWS resources. Tagging entities and resources is the first step
                                    of ABAC. Then you 
                                    design ABAC policies to allow operations when the principal's tag matches the tag
                                    on the resource that they 
                                    are trying to access.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>ABAC is helpful in environments that are growing rapidly and helps with situations
                                    where policy management becomes cumbersome.

                                 <p>You can manually create temporary credentials using the AWS CLI or AWS API. You can
                                    then use those temporary credentials to access AWS. AWS recommends that you
                                    dynamically generate temporary credentials instead of using long-term access keys.

                                    When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are considered a principal.
                                    Policies 
                                    grant permissions to a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an
                                    action that then triggers 
                                    another action in a different service. In this case, you must have permissions to
                                    perform both actions. To 
                                    see whether an action requires additional dependent actions in a policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awskeymanagementservice.html">Actions, resources, and condition keys for Fleet Hub for AWS IoT Device Management</a> in the

                                    actions on your behalf. Service roles  provide access only within your account and
                                    cannot be  used to grant access to 
                                    services in other accounts. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a

                                    A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service.
                                    The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. 
                                    Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service. An IAM
                                    administrator can view, 
                                    but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.
