# Add profiles to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN<a name="connect-iot-lorawan-define-profiles"></a>

Device and service profiles can be defined to describe common device configurations\. These profiles describe configuration parameters that are shared by devices to make it easier to add those devices\. AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN supports device profiles and service profiles\.

 The configuration parameters and the values to enter into these profiles are provided by the device's manufacturer\.

**Device profiles**  
Device profiles contain the communication and protocol parameter values the device needs to communicate with the network server\. The parameters used in a profile depend on the protocol type, version, and supported options\.

**Service profiles**  
Service profiles describe the communication parameters the device needs to communicate with the application server\.
