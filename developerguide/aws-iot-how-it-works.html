                                             AWS IoT Analytics automates each difficult step that is required to
                                             analyze data from IoT devices. AWS IoT Analytics filters, transforms,
                                             and enriches IoT data before storing it in a time-series data store
                                             for analysis. You can analyze your data by running one-time or
                                             scheduled queries using the built-in SQL query engine or machine

                                             engine. You can use an SQL-based language to select data from

                                             that describe a device. Devices use certificates to authenticate
                                             with AWS IoT. Policies determine which operations a device can perform
                                             in AWS IoT.

                                             them into groups. Groups can also contain groups—you can build
                                             a hierarchy of groups. Any action that you perform on a parent group
                                             will apply to its child groups. The same action also applies to all

                                          <p>Brings Alexa Voice to any connected device. AVS for AWS IoT
                                             reduces the cost and complexity of integrating Alexa. This feature
                                             uses AWS IoT to offload intensive computational and memory audio tasks
                                             from the device to the cloud. Because of the resulting reduction in
                                             the engineering bill of materials (EBOM) cost, device makers can
                                             cost-effectively bring Alexa to resource-constrained IoT devices,
                                             and enable consumers to talk directly to Alexa in parts of their
                                             home, office, or hotel rooms for an ambient experience.

                                          <p>AVS for AWS IoT enables Alexa built-in functionality on MCUs, such
                                             as the ARM Cortex M class with less than 1 MB embedded RAM. To do
                                             so, AVS offloads memory and compute tasks to a virtual Alexa
                                             Built-in device in the cloud. This reduces EBOM cost by up to 50
                                             percent. For more information, see <a href="./avs-integration-aws-iot.html">Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Integration for AWS IoT</a>.
