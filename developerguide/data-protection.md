# Data protection in AWS IoT Core<a name="data-protection"></a>

For more information about data protection, see the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model and GDPR](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/the-aws-shared-responsibility-model-and-gdpr/) blog post on the *AWS Security Blog*\.

AWS IoT devices gather data, perform some manipulation on that data, and then send that data to another web service\. You might choose to store some data on your device for a short period of time\. You are responsible for providing any data protection on that data at rest\. When your device sends data to AWS IoT it does so over a TLS connection as discussed later in this section\. AWS IoT devices can send data to any AWS service\. For more information about each service's data security, see the documentation for that service\. AWS IoT can be configured to write logs to CloudWatch Logs and log AWS IoT API calls to AWS CloudTrail\. For more information about data security for these services, see [ Authentication and Access Control for Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/auth-and-access-control-cw.html) and [Encrypting CloudTrail Log Files with AWS KMS\-Managed Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/encrypting-cloudtrail-log-files-with-aws-kms.html)\.
