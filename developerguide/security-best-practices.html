                                 <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS IoT Core</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> is a managed cloud
                                    service that makes it possible for connected devices to interact with cloud applications
                                    and other devices easily and securely. AWS IoT Core supports HTTP, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>WebSocket</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>MQTT</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>, a lightweight communication
                                    protocol specifically designed to tolerate intermittent connections. If you are
                                    connecting to AWS IoT using MQTT, each of your connections must be
                                    associated with an identifier known as a client ID. MQTT client IDs uniquely identify
                                    MQTT connections. If a new connection is established using a client ID that is already
                                    claimed for another connection, the AWS IoT message broker drops the old connection
                                    to
                                    allow the new connection. Client IDs must be unique within each AWS account and each
                                    AWS Region. This means that you don't need to enforce global uniqueness of client
                                    IDs
                                    outside of your AWS account or across Regions within your AWS account.

                                 <p>To avoid client ID conflicts and their potential negative impacts, make sure that
                                    each
                                    device or mobile application has an AWS IoT or IAM policy that restricts which client
                                    IDs can be used for MQTT connections to the AWS IoT message broker. For example, you
                                    can
                                    use an IAM policy to prevent a device from unintentionally closing another device's
                                    connection by using a client ID that is already in use. For more information, see

                                    as
                                    publishing messages or subscribing to topics with specific scope and context. The
                                    specific permission policies can vary for your use cases. Identify the permission
                                    policies that best meet your business and security requirements.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>To simplify creation and management of permission policies, you can use <a href="./iot-policy-variables.html">AWS IoT Core policy variables</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html">IAM policy variables</a>. Policy variables can be placed in a policy and when
                                    the policy is evaluated, the variables are replaced by values that come from the
                                    device's request. Using policy variables, you can create a single policy for granting
                                    permissions to multiple devices. You can identify the relevant policy variables for
                                    your
                                    use case based on your AWS IoT account configuration, authentication mechanism, and
                                    network protocol used in connecting to AWS IoT message broker. However, to write the
                                    best
                                    permission policies, consider the specifics of your use case and your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>threat model</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.

                                 <p>For example, if you registered your devices in the AWS IoT registry, you can use <a href="./thing-policy-variables.html">thing policy variables</a> in
                                    AWS IoT policies to grant or deny permissions based on thing properties like thing
                                    names,
                                    thing types, and thing attribute values. The thing name is obtained from the client
                                    ID
                                    in the MQTT connect message sent when a thing connects to AWS IoT. The thing policy
                                    variables are replaced when a thing connects to AWS IoT over MQTT using TLS mutual
                                    authentication or MQTT over the WebSocket protocol using authenticated <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identities.html">Amazon Cognito identities</a>. You can use the
                                    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_AttachThingPrincipal.html">AttachThingPrincipal</a> API to attach certificates and

                                    is a useful thing policy variable to enforce client ID restrictions. The following
                                    example AWS IoT policy requires a registered thing's name to be used as the client
                                    ID for

                                 <p>It's important to have an accurate time on your device. X.509 certificates have an
                                    expiry date and time. The clock on your device is used to verify that a server certificate
                                    is still valid. If you're building commercial IoT devices, remember that your products
                                    may
                                    be stored for extended periods before being sold. Real-time clocks can drift during
                                    this 
                                    time and batteries can get discharged, so setting time in the factory is not sufficient.
                                 </p> 
                                 
                                 <p>For most systems, this means that the device's software must include a network time
                                    protocol (NTP) client. The device should wait until it synchronizes with an NTP server
                                    before it tries to connect to AWS IoT Core. If this isn't possible, the system should
                                    provide a way for a user to set the device's time so that subsequent connections
                                    succeed.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>After the device synchronizes with an NTP server, it can open a connection with
                                    AWS IoT Core. How much clock skew that is allowed depends on what you're trying to
                                    do with
                                    the connection. 
                                 </p>

                                 <p>The first thing a device does to interact with AWS IoT is to open a secure connection.
                                    When you connect your device to AWS IoT, ensure that you're talking to AWS IoT and
                                    not
                                    another server impersonating AWS IoT. Each of the AWS IoT servers is provisioned with
                                    a
                                    certificate issued for the <code class="code">iot.amazonaws.com</code> domain. This certificate was
                                    issued to AWS IoT by a trusted certificate authority that verified our identity and
                                    ownership of the domain.

                                    and that the server on the end of that connection possesses a certificate from a trusted

                                    for that domain.

                                 <p>TLS certificates are in X.509 format and include a variety of information such as
                                    the
                                    organization's name, location, domain name, and a validity period. The validity period
                                    is specified as a pair of time values
                                    called <code class="code">notBefore</code> and <code class="code">notAfter</code>. Services like AWS IoT Core use
                                    limited validity periods (for example, one year) for their server certificates and
                                    begin
                                    serving new ones before the old ones expire.

                                    a thermostat. The light bulb sends the status of its battery level, and a thermostat
                                    sends messages that report the temperature.
