You can use the AWS IoT Streaming service to manage files and transfer them to AWS IoT devices in your fleet\. In the AWS Cloud, you can create a *stream* that contains multiple files, you can update stream data \(the file list and descriptions\), get the stream data, and more\. The AWS IoT Streaming service can transfer data in small blocks to your IoT devices, using the MQTT protocol with support for request and response messages in JSON or CBOR\.
