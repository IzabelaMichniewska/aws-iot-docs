                                 <p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that helps an administrator
                                    securely control access
                                    to AWS resources. IAM administrators control who can be <em>authenticated</em> (signed in) and <em>authorized</em>
                                    (have permissions) to use AWS IoT resources. IAM is an AWS service that you can
                                    use with no additional charge.

                                 <p>How you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) differs, depending on the work
                                    that you do in AWS IoT.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p><b>Service user</b> – If you use the AWS IoT service to do your job, then your administrator provides
                                    you
                                    with the credentials and permissions that you need. As you use more AWS IoT features
                                    to do your work, you might need additional permissions.
                                    Understanding how access is managed can help you request the right permissions from
                                    your administrator. If you cannot access a feature in
                                    AWS IoT, see <a href="./security_iam_troubleshoot.html">Troubleshooting AWS IoT identity

                                 <p><b>Service administrator</b> – If you're in charge of AWS IoT resources at your company, you probably have
                                    full access to AWS IoT. It's your job to determine which AWS IoT features and resources
                                    your employees should access. You must then
                                    submit requests to your IAM administrator to change the permissions of your service
                                    users. Review the information on this page to understand the
                                    basic concepts of IAM. To learn more about how your company can use IAM with AWS IoT,

                                 <p><b>IAM administrator</b> – If you're an IAM administrator, you might want to learn details about how you can
                                    write policies to manage access to AWS IoT. To view example AWS IoT identity-based
                                    policies that you can use in IAM, see <a href="./security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html">AWS IoT identity-based

                                 <p>In AWS IoT identities can be device (X.509) certificates, Amazon Cognito identities,
                                    or IAM users
                                    or groups. This topic discusses IAM identities only. For more information about the

                                 <p>Authentication is how you sign in to AWS using your identity credentials. For more
                                    information about signing in using the AWS Management Console, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console.html">Signing in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user or root user</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>You must be <em>authenticated</em> (signed in to AWS) as the
                                    AWS account root user, an IAM user, or by assuming an IAM role. You can also use your
                                    company's
                                    single sign-on authentication or even sign in using Google or Facebook. In these cases,
                                    your administrator previously set up identity federation using IAM roles. When you
                                    access
                                    AWS using credentials from another company, you are assuming a role indirectly. 
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>To sign in directly to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS Management Console</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>, use your
                                    password with your root user email address or your IAM user name. You can access AWS
                                    programmatically using your root user or IAM users access keys. AWS provides SDK and
                                    command line tools to cryptographically sign your request using your credentials.
                                    If you
                                    don't use AWS tools, you must sign the request yourself. Do this using
                                    <em>Signature Version 4</em>, a protocol for authenticating inbound API
                                    requests. For more information about authenticating requests, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 signing process</a>
                                    in the <em>AWS General Reference</em>.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>Regardless of the authentication method that you use, you might also be required to
                                    provide additional security information. For example, AWS
                                    recommends that you use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to increase the security
                                    of your account. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html">Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) in AWS</a> in the

                                 <p>
                                    
                                    When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in
                                    identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account.
                                    This
                                    identity is called the AWS account <em>root user</em> and is accessed by
                                    signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account.
                                    We 
                                    strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even
                                    the
                                    administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users">best practice of
                                       using the root user only to create your first IAM user</a>. Then securely lock away

                                             available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached

                                 <p>You control access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities
                                    or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that,
                                    when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. You can sign
                                    in as the root user or an IAM user, or you can assume an IAM
                                    role. When you then make a request, AWS evaluates the related identity-based or resource-based
                                    policies. Permissions in the policies determine 
                                    whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON
                                    documents. For more information about the structure and contents 
                                    of JSON policy documents, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policies-json">Overview of JSON policies</a> in the

                                 <p>Every IAM entity (user or role) starts with no permissions. In other words, by default,
                                    users can do nothing, not even change their own password. To give a
                                    user permission to do something, an administrator must attach a permissions policy
                                    to a user. Or the administrator can add the user to a group that has
                                    the intended permissions. When an administrator gives permissions to a group, all
                                    users in that group are granted those permissions.

                                    to perform the operation. For example, suppose that you have a
                                    policy that allows the <code class="code">iam:GetRole</code> action. A user with that policy can get role information from the AWS Management
                                    Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS
                                    API.

                                          <p><b>Service control policies (SCPs)</b> – SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for
                                             an organization or organizational unit (OU) in AWS Organizations. AWS Organizations
                                             is a service for grouping and centrally managing multiple AWS accounts that your business
                                             owns. If you enable all features in an organization, then you can apply service control
                                             policies (SCPs) to any or all of
                                             your accounts. The SCP limits permissions for entities in member accounts, including
                                             each AWS account root user. For more information about Organizations and
                                             SCPs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_about-scps.html">How SCPs work</a> in the <em>AWS Organizations User Guide</em>.

                                             temporary session for a role or federated user. The resulting session's
                                             permissions are the intersection of the user or role's identity-based policies and
                                             the session policies. Permissions can also come from a resource-based policy. An
                                             explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For more information,
