# MQTT<a name="mqtt"></a>

[MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) is a lightweight and widely adopted messaging protocol that is designed for constrained devices\. AWS IoT support for MQTT is based on the [MQTT v3\.1\.1 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html), with some differences\. For information about how AWS IoT differs from the MQTT v3\.1\.1 specification, see [AWS IoT differences from MQTT version 3\.1\.1 specification](#mqtt-differences)\.

The easiest way to connect to AWS IoT over MQTT is by using one of the [AWS IoT Device and Mobile SDKs](iot-sdks.md)\. For information about how to connect to devices using the AWS Device SDKs and links to examples of AWS IoT in the supported languages, see [Connecting with MQTT using the AWS IoT Device SDKs](#mqtt-sdk)\. For more information about authentication methods and the port mappings for MQTT messages, see [Protocols, port mappings, and authentication](protocols.md#protocol-port-mapping)\.

## MQTT Quality of Service \(QoS\) options<a name="mqtt-qos"></a>

AWS IoT and the AWS IoT Device SDKs support the [MQTT Quality of Service \(QoS\) levels `0` and `1`](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc385349263)\. The MQTT protocol defines a third level of QoS, level `2`, but AWS IoT does not support it\. Only the MQTT protocol supports the QoS feature\. HTTPS does not support QoS\.

This table describes how each QoS level affects messages published to and by the message broker\. 


|  With a QoS level of\.\.\.  |  The message is\.\.\.  |  Comments  | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  QoS level 0  |  Sent zero or more times  |  This level should be used for messages that are sent over reliable communication links or that can be missed without a problem\.  | 
|  QoS level 1  |  Sent at least one time, and then repeatedly until a `PUBACK` response is received  |  The message is not considered complete until the sender receives a `PUBACK` response to indicate successful delivery\.  | 

## Using MQTT persistent sessions<a name="mqtt-persistent-sessions"></a>

Persistent sessions store subscription information and pending Quality of Service \(QoS\) 1 messages in case your devices become disconnected\. When a device reconnects, its persistent session resumes and its subscriptions are automatically reinstated\. Also, any stored messages are delivered\.

A persistent session represents an ongoing connection to an MQTT message broker\. When a client connects to the message broker using a persistent session, the message broker saves all subscriptions that the client makes during the connection\. When the client disconnects, the message broker stores unacknowledged QoS 1 messages and new QoS 1 messages published to topics to which the client is subscribed\. When the client reconnects to the persistent session, all subscriptions are reinstated and all stored messages are sent to the client at a maximum rate of 10 messages per second\.

You create an MQTT persistent session by sending a CONNECT message and setting the `cleanSession` flag to 0\. If no session exists for the client sending the CONNECT message, a new persistent session is created\. If a session already exists for the client, it's resumed\.

After the client joins the session, it can continue to publish messages and subscribe to topic filters without any additional flags on each operation\. The following conditions describe how persistent sessions begin and end\.
+ A persistent session ends and can't be resumed when the client sends a CONNECT message that sets the `cleanSession` flag to 1\.
+ By default, a persistent session expires one hour after the message broker detects that a client has disconnected\. You can configure this time interval\.
+ When a client reconnects after the session has expired and sets the `cleanSession` flag to 0, the service creates a new persistent session\. Subscriptions and messages from the previous session are discarded\.

Devices use the `sessionPresent` attribute in the connection acknowledged \(CONNACK\) message to determine if a persistent session is present\. If `sessionPresent` is set to 1, a persistent session is present and stored messages are delivered to the client\. This starts immediately after the device receives the CONNACK\. There is no need to resubscribe\. If `sessionPresent` is set to 0, no persistent session is present and the client must resubscribe to its topic filters\. 

Persistent sessions have a default expiry period of one hour\. The expiry period begins when the message broker detects that a client disconnects \(MQTT disconnect or timeout\)\. The persistent session expiry period can be increased through the standard limit increase process\. If a client has not resumed its session within the expiry period, the session is terminated and any associated stored messages are discarded\. The expiry period is approximate\. Sessions might be persisted for up to 30 minutes longer, but not less than the configured duration\. For more information, see [ AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html)\. Any messages stored for persistent sessions are billed at the standard messaging rate\. For more information, see [AWS IoT Core Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/pricing)\.

## Using connectAttributes<a name="connect-attribute"></a>

`ConnectAttributes` allow you to specify what attributes you want to use in your connect message in your IAM policies such as `PersistentConnect` and `LastWill`\. With `ConnectAttributes`, you can build policies that don't give devices access to new features by default, which can be helpful if a device is compromised\. 

`connectAttributes` supports the following features:

`PersistentConnect`  
Use the `PersistentConnect` feature to save all subscriptions the client makes during the connection when the connection between the client and broker is interrupted\.

`LastWill`  
Use the `LastWill` feature to publish a message to the `LastWillTopic` when a client unexpectedly disconnects\.

By default, your policy has non\-persistent connection and there are no attributes passed for this connection\. You must specify a persistent connection in your IAM policy if you want to have one\.

For `ConnectAttributes` examples, see [Connect Policy Examples](connect-policy.md)\.

## AWS IoT differences from MQTT version 3\.1\.1 specification<a name="mqtt-differences"></a>

The message broker implementation is based on the [MQTT v3\.1\.1 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html), but it differs from the specification in these ways:
+ AWS IoT supports MQTT Quality of Service \(QoS\) levels 0 and 1 only\. AWS IoT doesn't support publishing or subscribing with QoS level 2\. When QoS level 2 is requested, the message broker doesn't send a PUBACK or SUBACK\.
+ In AWS IoT, subscribing to a topic with QoS level 0 means that a message is delivered zero or more times\. A message might be delivered more than once\. Messages delivered more than once might be sent with a different packet ID\. In these cases, the DUP flag is not set\.
+ When responding to a connection request, the message broker sends a CONNACK message\. This message contains a flag to indicate if the connection is resuming a previous session\.
+ When a client subscribes to a topic, there might be a delay between the time the message broker sends a SUBACK and the time the client starts receiving new matching messages\.
+ The MQTT specification provides a provision for the publisher to request that the broker retain the last message sent to a topic and send it to all future topic subscribers\. AWS IoT does not support retained messages\. If a request is made to retain messages, the connection is disconnected\.
+ The message broker uses the client ID to identify each client\. The client ID is passed in from the client to the message broker as part of the MQTT payload\. Two clients with the same client ID can't be connected concurrently to the message broker\. When a client connects to the message broker using a client ID that another client is using, the new client connection is accepted and the previously connected client is disconnected\.
+ On rare occasions, the message broker might resend the same logical PUBLISH message with a different packet ID\.
+ The message broker doesn't guarantee the order in which messages and ACK are received\.
