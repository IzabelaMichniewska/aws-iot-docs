This section provides additional detail about the information you need to add and modify AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN resources by using the [AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN section of the AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home#/wireless/landing)\. Much of the data that you enter when configuring AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN resources is provided by the devices' vendors and is specific to the LoRaWAN specifications they support\. 

The console interface is most practical when managing a few AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN resources at a time\. When managing large numbers of AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN resources, consider creating more automated solutions by [using the AWS IoT Wireless API](connect-iot-lorawan-developer.md)\.
